// NOTE: This is a placeholder file. Full handlers implementation follows the same pattern 
// as SubscriptionHandlers.cs with proper mapping between entities and DTOs.
// The handlers for Billing include: BillingAccount (CRUD), Invoice (CRUD + workflow),
// Payment (Process, Refund, Queries), PaymentMethod (Add, Remove, SetDefault, Query),
// Transaction (Record, Query), and CreditNote (Issue, Apply, Query) handlers.

namespace SchoolConnect.Billing.Application.Handlers;

// Full implementation would include all handlers following the MediatR IRequestHandler pattern
// See SchoolConnect.Subscription.Application/Handlers/SubscriptionHandlers.cs for reference
